## Introduction
The sunny state of Florida, located in the southeastern part of the United States, is a dream place where people yearn for the good life. Introducing new sources of energy to improve Florida's energy generation and build a better, healthier, greener Florida is the challenge we need to address.

## Problems
Today, Florida's energy problems cannot be ignored. It uses more energy per capita than all but two states, and it is the fourth-largest energy consumer, consuming almost eight times as much energy as it produces. Its serious power consumption issue also leads to high CO2 emissions.  Florida ranked fourth in terms of Natural Gas Consumption while ranked third for total C02 Emissions.

Florida's high CO2 Emission is mainly due to the unfit resource structure, in other words, it has too many high-carbon sources but will have few renewable sources. The non-renewable resources Florida had,  such as natural gas, coal, and petroleum provided approximately 80.3% of Florida's energy and generated a significant amount of CO2 in the process of use. Additionally, its high-carbon source has an energy consumption of 3626.1 Trillion Btu whereas renewable energy with only 617.5 trillion Btu energy consumption. 

## Target
It is no exaggeration to say that optimizing Florida's energy structure and reducing carbon emissions are imminent. Using renewable energy instead of a high-carbon source is a more intuitive way, two methods could be used to reach this target, which could be concluded as **more renewable energy and less traditional energy**.
